$PBUILD WAS BORN OUT OF FRUSTRATION
Frustration from seeing shitcoins get hyped because a dev wrote something about the space needed a “reset” or how there’s a “resurgence” coming at the top of the contract. Whoopty f**king doo!

They’d promise buybacks but go to sleep on their communities and that really pisses me off.

People invest their money when they are inspired and there’s nothing worse than watching a group of inspired investors lose hope so quickly.

What is more frustrating than ever is these devs don’t have a creative bone in their bodies. Perhaps the truth is, they are just incapable of writing unique functions and just fork the latest shit to try and make a buck at the expense of degens.

Well, frustration can breed change, and that’s exactly what $PBUILD attempts to do.

I’m writing in a function no one has ever seen before. A function that rewards investors who join forces to create buy walls and help send this token to new heights every day.

As devs know, loops aren’t possible in solidity, so I’ve created a counter instead that will count the number of consecutive buys and record the buyer’s wallets who form a flow of consecutive buys – AKA a buy wall.
